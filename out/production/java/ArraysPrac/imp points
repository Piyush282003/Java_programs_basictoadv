The NumberFormatException is an unchecked exception in Java that occurs when an attempt is made to convert a string with an
incorrect format to a numeric value.Therefore, this exception is thrown when it is not possible to convert a string to a numeric
type (e.g. int, float).


NullPointerException is a runtime exception in Java that occurs when a variable is accessed which is not pointing to any object and
refers to nothing or null. Since the NullPointerException is a runtime exception, it doesn't need to be caught and handled explicitly
in application code.
